\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he Road Not Taken} \\
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

\lettrine[lines=2]{T}{} hen took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.

\lettrine{断}{章}
你站在桥上看风景，
看风景人在楼上看你。
明月装饰了你的窗子，
你装饰了别人的梦。
